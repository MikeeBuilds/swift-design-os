# Swift DesignOS

The missing design process between your product idea and your codebase.

Swift DesignOS is a Swift/SwiftUI implementation of the DesignOS product planning tool. It helps you define your product vision, structure your data model, design your UI, and export production-ready components for implementation.

## What This Is

A planning tool, not a component library. It bridges the gap between:
- **Product ideas** → Structured specifications
- **Design decisions** → Portable handoff packages
- **AI coding agents** → Complete implementation context

## Platforms

- iOS 17+
- macOS 15+
- watchOS 10+
- tvOS 17+

## Getting Started

### Using the Planning Tool

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/swift-design-os.git
cd swift-design-os

# Open in Xcode
open App/swift-design-os-app/swift-design-os-app.xcodeproj
```

Run the app and follow the guided workflow to plan your product.

### Using the SPM Package in Your Projects

Add Swift DesignOS as a package dependency to your iOS/macOS/watchOS/tvOS app:

1. **File → Add Package Dependencies**
2. **Enter package URL** (once published) or **Add Local Package**
3. **Import modules**: `import SwiftDesignOS`

## The Workflow

1. **Product Planning** — Define vision, roadmap, data model, design system, shell
2. **Section Design** — For each feature: spec, sample data, screen designs
3. **Export** — Generate complete handoff package for implementation

Each step is conversational. The AI asks questions, you provide direction, and together you shape a product that matches your vision.
