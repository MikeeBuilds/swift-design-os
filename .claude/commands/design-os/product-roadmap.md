# Product Roadmap

Break your product into independent, buildable sections. This makes development manageable and allows for incremental delivery.

Let me guide you through this step by step.

## Understanding Your Product

First, I need to understand what you're building:

1. **What problem does your product solve?**
2. **Who is your target user?**
3. **What is the core value proposition?**

## Defining Your Sections

A good section is:
- **Self-contained**: Can be built and tested independently
- **Focused**: Addresses a specific user need or feature area
- **Complete**: Has a clear starting and ending point
- **Buildable**: Has all the data and UI it needs to function

### Example Sections

For a task management app:
1. **Task Management** - Create, view, edit, and delete individual tasks
2. **Lists & Projects** - Organize tasks into lists and project hierarchies
3. **Search & Filters** - Find and filter tasks across all projects

For a social media app:
1. **Feed & Timeline** - View posts from followed accounts in chronological order
2. **Profile Management** - User profile with posts, bio, and settings
3. **Content Creation** - Create and post new content with media

## Your Roadmap

Please list **3-5 sections** for your product. For each section, provide:

**Format:**
```
## Priority N: [Section Title]

[One-sentence description of what this section does]
```

**Example:**
```
## Priority 1: Task Management

Create, view, edit, and delete individual tasks with titles, descriptions, and due dates.
```

## Ordering Guidelines

Order sections by:
1. **User value**: What delivers the most value first?
2. **Technical dependencies**: What sections do other sections rely on?
3. **Risk reduction**: Tackle uncertain or complex areas early?

## Questions to Consider

As you define your sections, think about:

- Can a user experience and test this section in isolation?
- Does this section have all the data it needs to function?
- Can a developer build this section without touching other sections?
- Is the scope of this section realistic to complete in one development cycle?

**Ready?** Please share your 3-5 sections, and I'll help you refine and validate them before we move to the next step.
