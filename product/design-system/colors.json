  "_description": "This file defines the color palette for TaskFlow. Colors are organized by semantic purpose (primary, secondary, neutral, semantic). All colors should support both light and dark modes through the use of dynamic system colors or explicit light/dark variants.",
  "_swiftUsage": "In SwiftUI, use Color(hex: string) extension or create color assets in Assets.xcassets. For dynamic appearance, prefer SF Symbols colors or system colors: Color.primary, Color.secondary, etc.",
  "_colorFormat": "Hex colors in #RRGGBB or #RRGGBBAA format. For system colors, use semantic names (e.g., 'systemBlue') to get automatic dark mode support.",
  
  "primary": {
    "_comment": "Primary brand color used for main actions, active states, and brand identity. TaskFlow uses a calming blue that feels productive and trustworthy.",
    "default": "#007AFF",

    "_notes": "Matches iOS system blue for native feel. Use for primary buttons, active tabs, and selection indicators."
